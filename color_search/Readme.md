# Color & Image Search

## Overview

This project implements a color and image search feature that allows users to find images based on color selection or uploaded images. The system utilizes two main methods:

1. **Color Selection:** Users can either choose a color using a color picker, input a hex code, or upload an image to extract the dominant color for searching.
2. **Image Upload:** Users can directly upload an image, and the system extracts dominant colors or generates a color palette for searching.

These methods are combined to provide a flexible search experience, allowing users to refine their searches based on color similarity and image content.

## Features

### Color Selection

- **User-friendly Input:** Provides multiple options for selecting colors, including a color picker, hex code input, and image upload.
- **Color Matching:** Utilizes color difference algorithms to find images with similar colors in the database.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Precomputes dominant colors for database images for faster searching.

### Image Upload

- **Color Extraction:** Extracts dominant color(s) or generates color palettes from uploaded images.
- **Search by Extracted Colors:** Matches database images based on the extracted colors or color palettes.
- **Combined Methods:** Allows users to combine color selection and image upload for a comprehensive search experience.

## Technical Details

- **Image Database:** Utilizes a suitable database structure to store image metadata, including precomputed dominant colors or color palettes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimizes image preprocessing and database queries for efficient search results, especially for large image collections.
- **User Interface:** Implements a clear and intuitive interface with visual feedback to guide users through the search process.

## Additional Tips

- **Color Range Specification:** Allows users to specify a color range for more flexible searches.
- **Color Scheme Options:** Provides options for searching by complementary, analogous, or triadic color schemes.
- **Integration with Color Theory Resources:** Integrates with color theory resources to educate users about color combinations and inspire their searches.

By combining these methods, the system offers a powerful and user-friendly color and image search feature that enhances the website's functionality and caters to different user preferences.
